## Background Reading

Please see discussion [here](https://github.com/TheFoundryVisionmongers/OpenAssetIO/discussions/259)

The two changes motivating this discussion which we believe are vital to the consistency of the API and its long term suitability in a variety of asset centric workflows are:

* [Trait based identification](https://github.com/TheFoundryVisionmongers/OpenAssetIO/pull/238)
* [Unified entity data model](https://github.com/TheFoundryVisionmongers/OpenAssetIO/pull/253)

## Notes

The consensus seems to be that our current plans are fine and we can move forward with the trait based rather than hierarchical system
