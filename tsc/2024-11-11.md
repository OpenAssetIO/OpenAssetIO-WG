## Agenda

### Last month: 
  - Hybrid plugin system [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO-MediaCreation/pull/99)
  - Katana AssetAPI adapter [open sourcing prep work](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/issues/1375).
  - Basic Asset Library (BAL) [runtime database updates](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO-Manager-BAL/issues/51)

### Current work: 
  - UI delegation [API design](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/issues/1302)
    - OS: Guidance somehow for DCC ISVs as to what standard UI elements
      they should support for delegation. DF: UI traits/specifications 
      can be a reference. RF: we should document this more explicitly.
      DF: Katana is a good reference, as it already has a set of
      delegated UI elements.
    - SR/OS: Consider use-case of "manifest dialog" showing all entities
      in a project, and providing the plugin with references to the
      native SDK object(s) where those entities are used. E.g. for 
      version pinning. TC: consider HostInterface class as a way to
      query SDK objects.
    - TC: Applications maintaining support for QWebView very useful for
      delegated UI elements.

  - pybind11 [minimum version pinning](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/issues/1420) 
    (e.g. `frozenset` support)
    * AssetIO-TraitGen v1.0.0-alpha.11 and OpenAssetIO-MediaCreation
      v1.0.0-alpha.11 released without `frozenset`.

### Next up:
  - Katana AssetAPI [open sourcing release](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/issues/1424)
  - Shotgrid/Flow [starter plugin](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/issues/964)

### AOB
  - OS: OpenAssetIO unfortunately not suitable for use ubiquitously
    in internal pipeline tooling due to the need to support old
    applications, in particular on old versions of Python. Had to come
    up with an alternative representation for OpenAssetIO MediaCreation
    traits. Will post a discussion/issue on OpenAssetIO GitHub
    explaining further. RF: we should reconsider level of support for
    older applications in light of this.
