## Agenda

### Last month: 
  - [Drop CY22 support, default to CY24](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/issues/1351)
    - TC/OS: Still plenty of software stuck on CY22 (or earlier), but
      workarounds are not too tricky.
  - UI delegation [de-risking](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/issues/1367) 
  - [v1.0.0-rc.1.0](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.1.0) !

### Current work: 
  - Katana AssetAPI adapter [open sourcing](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/issues/1346)

### Next up:
  - UI delegation [API design](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/issues/1302)
  - Minor quality of life enhancements (e.g. config file enhancements,
    BAL database config, CI improvements).

### AOB

  #### ASWF project progress

  - RF/DF: ASWF TAC voted to maintain "sandbox" status. Adoption is the
    main barrier to advancing to "incubation" status.
  - OS: Ynput can produce some documentation/examples to demo real-world
    OpenAssetIO usage, which may help drive adoption.

  #### Trait data types
  
  - OS: Would be very useful to support lists as a primitive data type
    in OpenAssetIO traits. Will post a GitHub issue with motivating 
    examples.
  - TC: Historically avoided this to prevent tools placing large amounts
    of data in traits, e.g. vertices of large geometry. 
  - OS: Should be the tool/pipeline's problem, not restricted by
    OpenAssetIO.
  - TC: Many use-cases for lists should instead be solved using
    relationships.
  - TC: Raises the question of how the semantics of the list is
    communicated, e.g. row-major vs. column-major matrix vs. fixed size
    vs dynamic size.
  - DF: Best try to align with Movielabs Ontology.
