# OpenAssetIO TSC May 13th 2024

## Agenda

### Compatibility
 - Much attention in the last few months over API & ABI compatibility
 - OpenAssetIO is in a unique space in this regard:
    - Technically separate Manager/Host compatibility
    - Cross-language compatibility concerns
    - As a foundational interop tech, do we need higher standards?
 - Do we need more granular breakage categories?
 - Interest to learn of other projects experiences in similar spaces
 - How can we be clearer/less intimidating to integrators around this? (https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/issues/1305)

### GUI Delegation
 - Some discussion recently about what initial steps into GUI delegation
   might look like
 - Potential categories of initial GUI delegation
   - Entity Control Widget
   - Asset Loading Browser
   - Asset Publishing Browser
 - What's in people heads as to what the first iteration of delegation
   could/should accomplish? What about the final iteration?
 - Minimal possible starting point?
