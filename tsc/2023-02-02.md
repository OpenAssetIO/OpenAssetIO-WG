# OpenAssetIO TSC Feb 2nd 2023

## Agenda

- AR2 prototype resolver update.
  - Functional prototype largely complete, with a few caveats
	[here](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/usdOpenAssetIOResolver). Need
	to pause work here for a while due to other team commitments.
  - TC/MD: Discussion around asset mutability, AR2 has a 'modification
	time' query.
	- DF: This could be moddeled with a trait if we want to build it
	  into the standard API set.
- OTIO prototype update.
	- `getRelatedRefrences`
	  [sketch](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO-MediaCreation/pull/21)
	  available for perusal.
- Siggraph planning
	- TC: Be great to work out some e2e demos for SIGGRAPH, ideas:
	  - Movelabs Ontology -> OpenAssetIO traits
	  - Multiref OTIO workflow
	- MD: Might line up with some of the Movielabs potential timescales.
