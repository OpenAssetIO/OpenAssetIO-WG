# OpenAssetIO TSC May 12th 2025

Attending:

- David Feltell (Foundry)
- Rob Fanner (Foundry)

## Agenda

### Current work:

- (Unchanged) Flow Production Tracking plugin open sourcing imminent -
  just awaiting exec review.

- KatanaOpenAssetIO improvements, esp. publishing support.
  * [Pull Request](https://github.com/TheFoundryVisionmongers/KatanaOpenAssetIO/pull/4) 
    currently under review.

- ASWF Dev Days support

### To discuss

- From Katana: "Save" vs. "Version Up and Save" - should we support the
  distinction, if so how?
  * PR implements "Save" as a `kWrite` relationship query, specifying
    version as a filter predicate.
  * DF: Low attendance at TSC - will ask around on Slack after Dev Days.
  
### Next up:

- (Unchanged) Ayon manager plugin improvements with a view to demoing
  with KatanaOpenAssetIO.

### AOB

- RF: What is the state of UI delegation?
- DF: Merged as of last TSC.
- RF: So are we ready to call it OpenAssetIO v1.0.0?
- DF: Only remaining issues in the v1.0.0 milestone are Flow plugin and
  Katana plugin, which are both developed enough now to validate the
  API. Not many changes between RC.1 and RC.2, and Nuke 16 been out for
  a while with RC.1. So yeah maybe it's time.
- RF: But what about the publishing question raised by the Katana work?
- DF: Good point, we should wait for that to be resolved before calling
  it v1.0.0.
