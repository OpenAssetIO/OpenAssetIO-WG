  ### If we have time
  - What's worth a breaking change in mediacreation? (LocatableContentTrait - getUrl vs. getLocation)
  - Path to URL full-compliance niggles
    - Are `\\.\` UNC paths of any importance for path->URL conversion?
    - Is converting a long path to a Windows non-normalised `\\?\` device path to work around MAX_PATH limit really important?
