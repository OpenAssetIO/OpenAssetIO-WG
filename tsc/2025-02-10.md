## Agenda

### Last month(s): 

  - A couple of quality of life tweaks - e.g. operators, bounds
    checking.
  - Code tidying
    * Clang-Tidy v12 -> v19.
    * Removed all TODO comments from code/docs.

### Current work:

Largely unchanged from last year:

  - UI delegation design [still awaiting feedback](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO-MediaCreation/pull/100).
    * Finally got some Foundry eyes on it.
  - Flow Production Tracking (Shotgun) [starter plugin](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/issues/964)
    * Slow, but still progressing.

### Next up:

  - Foundry changes:
    * Good: larger team now involved in OpenAssetIO development.
    * Bad: no more full-time development of OpenAssetIO.
  - Nuke 16 - OpenAssetIO RC.1.0 Trojan Horse
  - Asset Manager support?
