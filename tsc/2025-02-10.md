## Agenda

### Last month(s): 

  - A couple of quality of life tweaks - e.g. operators, bounds
    checking.
  - Code tidying
    * Clang-Tidy v12 -> v19.
    * Removed all TODO comments from code/docs.

### Current work:

Largely unchanged from last year:

  - UI delegation design [still awaiting feedback](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO-MediaCreation/pull/100).
    * Finally got some Foundry eyes on it.
  - Flow Production Tracking (Shotgun) [starter plugin](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/issues/964)
    * Slow, but still progressing.

### Next up:

  - Foundry changes:
    * Good: larger team now involved in OpenAssetIO development.
    * Bad: no more full-time development of OpenAssetIO.
  - Nuke 16 - OpenAssetIO RC.1.0 Trojan Horse
    * OS: not yet tried out Nuke 16's OpenAssetIO support but planning
      to.
  - Asset Manager support?
    * DF: we really need a more compelling demo than using BAL (mock 
      manager).
    * OS: Ynput planning to open source some real-world Ayon projects
      with assets and tasks etc, ready to use for demo/testing 
      purposes.
    * OS: will look into adding more traits support to Ayon.
    * DF: to OS, does Ayon have UI that can be delegated to?
    * OS: yes, a "loader" UI used across DCC tools.
    * DF: to OS, have you looked at Katana? Since that supports more
      complex features, e.g. versions (relationship queries).
    * OS: not yet, customers don't use it, but might look into it as
      a side-project.

### AOB

  - OS: just posted a rundown of Ayon traits, inspired by (and broadly 
    backward compatible with) OpenAssetIO traits, as [an issue in the
    MediaCreation repo](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO-MediaCreation/issues/111)
  
  - JSM: working with Blender Foundation to look into pipeline 
    integration, in particular file path resolution.
    * DF: <showed link to [Blender OpenAssetIO demo](https://github.com/elliotcmorris/openassetio-relationships-blender)>
    * DF: recalled old forum discussion with Blender re. their asset 
      library. 
    * JSM: approaching Blender is best done by attending public
      meetings, rather than through online forums.
  
  - JSM: game industry is sorely lacking dedicated pipeline devs. 
    * OS: in our experience after approx 15 people you require dedicated
      pipeline devs.
