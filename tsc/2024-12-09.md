## Agenda

### Last month: 
  - Katana AssetAPI adapter - [KatanaOpenAssetIO released](https://github.com/TheFoundryVisionmongers/KatanaOpenAssetIO)!

### Current work: 
  - UI delegation design [still awaiting feedback](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO-MediaCreation/pull/100).
  - Flow Production Tracking (Shotgun/Shotgrid) [starter plugin](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/issues/964)

### Next up:
  - Implement [trait versioning](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO-TraitGen/issues/80)
    * OS: Agreed trait versioning definitely important.
  - Implement UI delegation.

### AOB
  - RF: Worth mentioning the investigation into the current state of the
    MovieLabs Ontology. 
    * DF: Well reminded - the Venn diagram of MovieLabs OMC and
      OpenAssetIO MediaCreation traits is barely overlapping right now.
      Theoretically, an OMC to traits converter would be difficult due
      to recursive schemas and additional namespacing, and would
      probably be easier to just convert manually.
    * MD: Did a spike to look at OMC <-> USD conversion and indeed you
      hit custom schema territory quickly, it's not really possible to
      generically convert.
  - OS: Will post a link to an Ayon PR with a custom Python trait
    implementation, which includes validation.
