## Agenda

### Part 1: Entity Traits
* The new OpenAssetIO-MediaCreation Repository
* Upcoming collaboration to build up more traits that cover common post-production assets.
* OpenPype integration
* MovieLabs JSON Ontology
* How do we avoid an endless cycle of refinement here?
* Question: We want to automate code generation for traits, most likely from a JSON description. Does anyone have any experience of autogenerating code from generic definitions e.g. usdGenSchema?

## Part 2: Published Packages
* We are currently thinking of PyPi and Conan to make OpenAssetIO publicly available, it is a non trivial amount of work to organise at this point, so it would be good to get a sense of what the preference is
* Question: Are Conan and/or PyPi useful? Or is it preferred to build from source?
* Question: What do distribution forms do people expect with mixed language packages?
* Question: Are there any specific requests, or things to look out for, good and bad practices.
