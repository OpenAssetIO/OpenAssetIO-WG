## Agenda

### Part 1: Entity Traits
* Update on Progress [0:60](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-roN0Dn63BLiX8_lLJ40oCqlRTkYZfhY/view?t=60)
* The new OpenAssetIO-MediaCreation Repository and upcoming collaboration to build up more traits that cover common post-production assets.[7:33](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-roN0Dn63BLiX8_lLJ40oCqlRTkYZfhY/view?t=453)
* OpenPype integration [8:16](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-roN0Dn63BLiX8_lLJ40oCqlRTkYZfhY/view?t=496)
* MovieLabs JSON Ontology [11:45](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-roN0Dn63BLiX8_lLJ40oCqlRTkYZfhY/view?t=705)
* How do we avoid an endless cycle of refinement here? [24:07](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-roN0Dn63BLiX8_lLJ40oCqlRTkYZfhY/view?t=1447)
* Discussion: We want to automate code generation for traits, most likely from a JSON description. Does anyone have any experience of autogenerating code from generic definitions e.g. usdGenSchema? [28:31](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-roN0Dn63BLiX8_lLJ40oCqlRTkYZfhY/view?t=1711)

### Part 2: Published Packages
* We are currently thinking of PyPi and Conan to make OpenAssetIO publicly available, it is a non trivial amount of work to organise at this point, so it would be good to get a sense of what the preference is [30:54](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-roN0Dn63BLiX8_lLJ40oCqlRTkYZfhY/view?t=1854)
* Discussion: Are Conan and/or PyPi useful? Or is it preferred to build from source? What do distribution forms do people expect with mixed language packages? [33:32](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-roN0Dn63BLiX8_lLJ40oCqlRTkYZfhY/view?t=2012)
* Discussion: Are there any specific requests, or things to look out for, good and bad practices. [38:04](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-roN0Dn63BLiX8_lLJ40oCqlRTkYZfhY/view?t=2284)

### AOB: General Questions
* Has the schemas work started at OpenPype? [45:00](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-roN0Dn63BLiX8_lLJ40oCqlRTkYZfhY/view?t=2700)
* Does the ontology from MovieLabs fit with OpenPype? [46:44](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-roN0Dn63BLiX8_lLJ40oCqlRTkYZfhY/view?t=2803)

## Background Reading

[DR007 Hierarchical or compositional traits for specifications](https://github.com/TheFoundryVisionmongers/OpenAssetIO/blob/main/decisions/DR007-Hierarchical-or-compositional-traits-for-specifications.md)

## Notes

* Follow up with JT required on importance of naming for ASWF

Traits

* MovieLabs + PYPE.club + Foundry to work on autogenerated traits from a common JSON description
* PYPE.club have been modelling post-production entity traits, MovieLabs have been modelling pre/production entity traits.
* Significant interest in working together on all this
* Check what is happening in the cloud world for code gen

Packages

* Larger studios will generally want to build from source
* Pre-built packages less of an issue at the current time, will aim for those later
* OTIOâ€™s cpp/Python approach has been working well in practice (incl static linking)
