# OpenAssetIO Working Group

The OpenAssetIO working group community is built around two themes.

- The TSC meetings, that shape the future roadmap of the project.
- Practical integration efforts.

## TSC Meeting

OpenAssetIO has a monthly TSC (Technical Steering Committee) meeting,
focusing on the mid-term roadmap, and other aspects of project
governance.

Details on the setup and function of the TSC are available on the main
ASWF site [here](https://tac.aswf.io/process/tsc_faq.html).

The TSC meeting is open to anyone who wishes to join, all meetings will
be recorded and posted publicly after the event.

Invite:

Meeting notes/slides can be found in the [tsc](./tsc) folder.

## Practical Integration

We coordinate discussion around the ongoing efforts to develop the
project, and build asset-centric workflows on the ASWF
`#openassetio` [Slack channel](https://academysoftwarefdn.slack.com/archives/C03Q36QS8N4),
and `openassetio-discuss` [mailing list.](https://lists.aswf.io/g/openassetio-discussion/topics).

Come join us!

Meeting notes/slides from relevant meetings can be found in the
[users](./users) folder.
